# Sales Pipeline Analysis

A data analysis project focused on exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling sales pipeline data to help understand conversion rates, identify bottlenecks, and predict deal outcomes. This repository contains code, notebooks, and supporting files to reproduce the analysis and modeling steps.

## Overview
Sales Pipeline Analysis walks through a typical analytics workflow for CRM/sales pipeline data:
- Data ingestion & cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Baseline and advanced predictive modeling
- Evaluation and recommendations

The outputs are intended to help sales and operations teams prioritize opportunities, understand pipeline health, and forecast outcomes.

## Goals
- Identify conversion rates across stages and segments
- Uncover common reasons for stalled opportunities
- Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of closing a deal
- Provide actionable visualizations and recommendations


## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Typical Python libraries:
  - pandas, numpy
  - matplotlib, seaborn
  - jupyterlab or notebook
